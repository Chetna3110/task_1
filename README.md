i took the file that was given in the task pdf (that is the "titanic-dataset") and then applied some data preprocessig techniques 
I firstly imported the dataset and explored basic info (nulls, data types).
Handled the  missing values using mean/median/imputation.
Converted the categorical features into numerical using encoding.
Normalized and standardized the numerical features.
and finally Visualized the outliers using boxplots and remove them.
